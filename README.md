# WELCOME TO MY SSPACE

Another Jekyll Blog Theme "EasyBook"

Start blogging with a simple but powerful theme.

## Features
Hi, I am Ange-Clement AKAZAN

## Install
My academic background helped me to have a solid knowledge of mathematical techniques used to
solve problems. Additionally, I have a strong foundation in probability and statistics, and a piece of
good knowledge about deep learning, machine learning, and AI from both a theoretical and practical
standpoint. I am a committed, diligent worker who is highly acquainted with Python programming
and is knowledgeable about data science-related Python libraries. I'm also familiar with SQL,
Excel, and R.
I enjoy teamwork, and I am always ready to come across and tackle new research challenges.
